**SMILEY CHROME EXTENTION**

Sadly, I do not have a developer account for chrome. But you can run this locally with these steps:

1. Download ZIP and extract.
2. Go to "chrome://extensions/" in google chrome (just type it in the address bar) and toggle developer mode. 
3. Click on the top left corner on "load unpacked". Select the extracted folder. 
4. Enable the extention. You may have to reload the page to use it. 

NOTE that this does not work on chrome sites, like "chrome://extensions/", but on other sites, like google.com.
